The Zeiss Ikon is an accessible entry point into medium format photography, offering stunning image quality - for the price, and a pocketable size. This post explores why this classic camera is a fantastic choice for those looking to elevate their photography without breaking the bank.

If you’re in the same position I was when I purchased this compact camera—seeking an affordable way to explore medium format photography or simply wanting to try something beyond 35mm film—then I have something for you! This could be your chance to get a glimpse into the world of 120mm film shooting.

## Introduction to the Zeiss Ikon 524 Camera

The Zeiss Ikon 524 is a classic folding medium format camera produced by the German company Zeiss Ikon. It features an uncoupled rangefinder, which means that once you have aligned the images in the rangefinder window, you can read the corresponding distance on the rangefinder wheel and transfer it to the lens focusing ring.
Despite having a rangefinder window, I would still classify it as a zone focus camera and use it that way. It's a fully manual camera with no light meter, which makes it quite straightforward. The camera features a leaf shutter, and all settings are adjusted directly on the lens.

Like many cameras from that era, there is no film advance mechanism other than a rewind knob. The frame counter is a small red window that displays the frame number printed directly on the back of the film. Therefore, you need to be careful when advancing the film, as there is nothing to prevent you from going too far and potentially missing a frame or double exposing part of an image.

Speaking of double exposure, you won't be able to experiment with it—at least not with the model I own (524/16)—as it has a mechanism that prevents double exposure by blocking the shutter release if the film has not been advanced. Which is sad.

## The Lens

The Zeiss Ikon 524/16 is equipped with a quality Tessar lens that produces excellent images. I rarely shoot wide open to reduce the risk of missing focus, ensuring that sharpness remains quite acceptable, and I don't notice much vignetting.

## Why This Camera Stands Out

What makes this camera great is its value, I found mine for less than $100 CAD; and the very acceptable image quality. Given its size—it's like having a medium format camera in your pocket—it’s a camera you’ll want to take with you everywhere!

## Conclusion

And the best argument to conclude this article is that this camera is very similar to **one of Ansel Adams' favorites: the Super Ikonta B.**
