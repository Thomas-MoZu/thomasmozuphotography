Getting into medium format photography isn't cheap, and shooting 6x7 is even more expensive! But could a 3D printed camera be the solution to that dilemma? Let's review this with the Dora Goodman's 3D printed body!

You might feel that it is nearly impossible to get into medium format without breaking the bank? Well, if you've already read my article about this [affordable 6x6](/blog/discovering-medium-format-the-zeiss-ikon-experience/), you know it's not necessarily the case. However, traditional 6x7 cameras can be quite expensive for several reasons. These cameras have often a high perceived value due to their high-end build quality and profesional features, such as interchangeable lenses, sophisticated light metering systems, and superior optics that enhance image quality. Cameras like the Mamiya 7/RB67/RZ67 or the Pentax 67 are amazing, but I wouldn’t say they are accessible in terms of cost for those looking to begin with medium format photography or even just to access 6x7 images. So, let’s dive into the review of what could be an affordable and decent option for shooting beautiful 6x7 images.

## The 3D printed body

When I was exploring medium format cameras, there were limited affordable options available for testing without spending a fortune on a Mamiya or Pentax. One viable solution was to 3D print a camera body and mount an existing lens on it. The 'Zone' designed by Dora Goodman, was at an early stage but still useful without any additional work. So I decided to took tat route.

So what is the 'Zone'? Well, it’s just a piece of 3D-printed plastic that holds a lens of your choice at the correct distance from your film. It is primarily designed for medium format.

Once printed, you just need to attach a lens to it, choose your film, and shoot. Pretty straightforward, huh?!

## Required parts and total cost

Lets break down what's required the get an image:
- The camera body (aka the Goodman Zone)
- A lens
- A film holder
- A viewfinder
- A shutter release cable (optional)

### The lens

The classic and easiest option is to find a lens from the Mamiya Press lineup. The most common are the 50mm f/6.3, 65mm f/6.3, 75mm f/5.6, 90mm f/3.5, and 100mm f/3.5. I personnaly went for the Mamiya-Sekor 65mm f/6.3 which give me a 28mm equivalent. They will cost you less than 200$CAD on eBay and are the cheapest.
They have also created a helical adapter which allows you to mount many large format lenses, but I haven't tested it.
Each one has its own built in shutter providing the same range of speeds from 1 second to 1/500th of a second.

### The film holder

The camera is originally built for the Mamiya RB67 Pro S back, but you can 3D print your own 6×6 film magazine if you want to save some money. I preferred to buy an RB67 back, as my goal was to shoot 6x7. Mamiya backs are widely available and it shouldn't be an issue to find one.

### Total cost

1. When I launched this project, I didn't have access to a 3D printer. Instead, I partnered with a local company to print the camera body, which likely raised my costs compared to printing it yourself. The total expense came to **$175 CAD**, covering the body, the shutter release cable holder, and the cold shoe mount,
1. The Mamiya-Sekor 65mm cost me **$160 CAD** on ebay, and included the viewfinder!
1. The Mamiya RB67 Pro S back cost me **$120 CAD** on ebay,
1. I paid **$20 CAD** for a vintage shutter release cable at my local camera store, cause I like to support them, but man! Twenty box for a vintage cable!!

This resulted in a solid medium format camera for **$475 CAD**, which is half the price of a Pentax and a quarter of a Mamiya 7!

I agree it's still expensive, especially when considering the drawbacks mentioned in the next paragraph. It's also four times the cost of the medium format camera I discuss in this article: [Discovering Medium Format - The Zeiss Ikon Experience](/blog/discovering-medium-format-the-zeiss-ikon-experience/)

## Pros and Cons

Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of your equipment is essential. Based on my experience with this camera, I've outlined a few pros and cons to help you determine if it's the right fit for your needs.

### Lets start with the Cons
- It's a zone focusing camera!
- Despite what is advertised on the official website, the lens and the back are held by screws, making it not so easy to swap lenses or backs.

### The Pros!
- Cheap for a 6x7!
- Light for a 6x7!
- Simple and sturdy. Other than some light leaks that are easy to fix, there isn't much that could go wrong with the camera.
- Customizable with a good selection of lenses, back options, and a wide range of accessories available. Plus, you can personalize the print with minimal skills.
