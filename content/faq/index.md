## Portrait Photography

<details>
    <summary>What are TFP shoots? And do you offer TFP sessions?</summary>
    Yes, I offer TFP, which stands for - Time for Print - where, both the photographer and the model agree to work together without payment. They are not working for nothing, instead they collaborate on a project to exchange services for edited images, benefiting both parties' portfolios.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What types of portrait sessions do you offer?</summary>
    I offer a range of portrait sessions, including individual portraits, family portraits, and professional headshots.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How long does a typical portrait session last?</summary>
    Most portrait sessions last between 1 to 2 hours, allowing enough time to capture a variety of poses and setups.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I choose the location for my portrait session?</summary>
    Absolutely! You can choose a location that is meaningful to you, whether it’s outdoors, in an urban setting, or in a studio environment.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How many images can I expect per shoot?</summary>
    Depending on the session's length and support used, you can typically expect around 5 to 20 final edited images from each shoot. Keep in mind that for 35mm film, I'll have 36 exposures per roll, while large format photography captures only one image per sheet. The type of support used will ultimately impact both the cost of the session and the number of images delivered.
