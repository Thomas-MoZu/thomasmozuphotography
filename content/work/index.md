Outdoor lover, I spend a lot of my time exploring the coastal mountains of the Pacific North West. My camera is always in my backpack, ready to capture the adventures we embark on together.

# Landscapes

I specialize in capturing the breathtaking landscapes of British Columbia’s stunning mountains and coastal regions. My passion for the outdoors drives me to explore and document the beauty of nature through my lens, whether it’s the serene vistas of the mountains or the thrilling action of local outdoor sports.

# Portrait

When I'm not in the mountains, I also enjoy working with models in the studio, focusing on portrait photography. I love experimenting with different lighting techniques and setups, exploring the nuances of light and shadow to create unique and compelling images. I apply a similar process to my product photography, where I strive to highlight the details and aesthetics of each item, ensuring they stand out in their own right.

Analog photography for portrait is something I particularly enjoy as it adds a distinct character and depth to the images that is characteristic of film photography.

# Analog

While I primarily shoot digital for action photography, portraits, and commercial work, I fell down the rabbit hole of film photography a few years ago. I’ve since collected a variety of old cameras, ranging from 35mm to 120mm and large format. I find the film process to be refreshingly different and truly enjoy the slower pace it demands—from taking the shot to developing and scanning the film. In a world where everything seems to happen immediately, this alternative approach allows me to step down for a moment and appreciate the true magic of photography.

# Events

My photography journey has been deeply influenced by my passion for outdoor sports, shaping my work in event photography. This passion drives me to capture the dynamic energy of various activities, like mountain biking, skiing and mountaineering. I also enjoy capturing indoor sporting events and live music for the energy and emotions these events provide.
