But could a 3D printed camera be the solution to that dilemma? Let\u0026rsquo;s review this with the Dora Goodman\u0026rsquo;s 3D printed body!\nYou might feel that it is nearly impossible to get into medium format without breaking the bank? Well, if you\u0026rsquo;ve already read my article about this affordable 6x6, you know it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily the case. However, traditional 6x7 cameras can be quite expensive for several reasons. These cameras have often a high perceived value due to their high-end build quality and profesional features, such as interchangeable lenses, sophisticated light metering systems, and superior optics that enhance image quality. Cameras like the Mamiya 7/RB67/RZ67 or the Pentax 67 are amazing, but I wouldn’t say they are accessible in terms of cost for those looking to begin with medium format photography or even just to access 6x7 images. So, let’s dive into the review of what could be an affordable and decent option for shooting beautiful 6x7 images.\nThe 3D printed body # When I was exploring medium format cameras, there were limited affordable options available for testing without spending a fortune on a Mamiya or Pentax. One viable solution was to 3D print a camera body and mount an existing lens on it. The \u0026lsquo;Zone\u0026rsquo; designed by Dora Goodman, was at an early stage but still useful without any additional work. So I decided to took tat route.\nSo what is the \u0026lsquo;Zone\u0026rsquo;? Well, it’s just a piece of 3D-printed plastic that holds a lens of your choice at the correct distance from your film. It is primarily designed for medium format.\nOnce printed, you just need to attach a lens to it, choose your film, and shoot. Pretty straightforward, huh?!\nPhoto by Jr Korpa on Unsplash Required parts and total cost # Lets break down what\u0026rsquo;s required the get an image:\nThe camera body (aka the Goodman Zone) A lens A film holder A viewfinder A shutter release cable (optional) The lens # The classic and easiest option is to find a lens from the Mamiya Press lineup. The most common are the 50mm f/6.3, 65mm f/6.3, 75mm f/5.6, 90mm f/3.5, and 100mm f/3.5. I personnaly went for the Mamiya-Sekor 65mm f/6.3 which give me a 28mm equivalent. They will cost you less than 200$CAD on eBay and are the cheapest. They have also created a helical adapter which allows you to mount many large format lenses, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested it. Each one has its own built in shutter providing the same range of speeds from 1 second to 1/500th of a second.\nThe film holder # The camera is originally built for the Mamiya RB67 Pro S back, but you can 3D print your own 6×6 film magazine if you want to save some money. I preferred to buy an RB67 back, as my goal was to shoot 6x7. Mamiya backs are widely available and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an issue to find one.\nThe Pro SD back is not compatible with this camera!\nTotal cost # When I launched this project, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to a 3D printer. Instead, I partnered with a local company to print the camera body, which likely raised my costs compared to printing it yourself. The total expense came to $175 CAD, covering the body, the shutter release cable holder, and the cold shoe mount, The Mamiya-Sekor 65mm cost me $160 CAD on ebay, and included the viewfinder! The Mamiya RB67 Pro S back cost me $120 CAD on ebay, I paid $20 CAD for a vintage shutter release cable at my local camera store, cause I like to support them, but man! Twenty box for a vintage cable!! This resulted in a solid medium format camera for $475 CAD, which is half the price of a Pentax and a quarter of a Mamiya 7!\nI agree it\u0026rsquo;s still expensive, especially when considering the drawbacks mentioned in the next paragraph. It\u0026rsquo;s also four times the cost of the medium format camera I discuss in this article: Discovering Medium Format - The Zeiss Ikon Experience\nPros and Cons # Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of your equipment is essential. Based on my experience with this camera, I\u0026rsquo;ve outlined a few pros and cons to help you determine if it\u0026rsquo;s the right fit for your needs.\nLets start with the Cons # It\u0026rsquo;s a zone focusing camera! Despite what is advertised on the official website, the lens and the back are held by screws, making it not so easy to swap lenses or backs. The Pros! # Cheap for a 6x7! Light for a 6x7! Simple and sturdy. Other than some light leaks that are easy to fix, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much that could go wrong with the camera. Customizable with a good selection of lenses, back options, and a wide range of accessories available. Plus, you can personalize the print with minimal skills.

This post explores why this classic camera is a fantastic choice for those looking to elevate their photography without breaking the bank.\nIf you’re in the same position I was when I purchased this compact camera—seeking an affordable way to explore medium format photography or simply wanting to try something beyond 35mm film—then I have something for you! This could be your chance to get a glimpse into the world of 120mm film shooting.\nIntroduction to the Zeiss Ikon 524 Camera # The Zeiss Ikon 524 is a classic folding medium format camera produced by the German company Zeiss Ikon. It features an uncoupled rangefinder, which means that once you have aligned the images in the rangefinder window, you can read the corresponding distance on the rangefinder wheel and transfer it to the lens focusing ring. Despite having a rangefinder window, I would still classify it as a zone focus camera and use it that way. It\u0026rsquo;s a fully manual camera with no light meter, which makes it quite straightforward. The camera features a leaf shutter, and all settings are adjusted directly on the lens.\nLike many cameras from that era, there is no film advance mechanism other than a rewind knob. The frame counter is a small red window that displays the frame number printed directly on the back of the film. Therefore, you need to be careful when advancing the film, as there is nothing to prevent you from going too far and potentially missing a frame or double exposing part of an image.\nSpeaking of double exposure, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to experiment with it—at least not with the model I own (524/16)—as it has a mechanism that prevents double exposure by blocking the shutter release if the film has not been advanced. Which is sad.\nThe Zeiss Ikon 524/16 The Lens # The Zeiss Ikon 524/16 is equipped with a quality Tessar lens that produces excellent images. I rarely shoot wide open to reduce the risk of missing focus, ensuring that sharpness remains quite acceptable, and I don\u0026rsquo;t notice much vignetting.\nTODO Shutter speeds\nA Medium Format Camera in Your Pocket!\nWhy This Camera Stands Out # What makes this camera great is its value, I found mine for less than $100 CAD; and the very acceptable image quality. Given its size—it\u0026rsquo;s like having a medium format camera in your pocket—it’s a camera you’ll want to take with you everywhere!\nSamples of images I took with the Zeiss Ikon 524/16 # ** Note that few are from very expired Kodak Portra 160\nPrevious Next ","date":"26 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/zeiss-ikon-524/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Discovering Medium Format - The Zeiss Ikon Experience","type":"posts"},{"content":" I value your feedback and inquiries!

Yes, all of my images are available for both print and licensing. Feel free to reach out for more details on how to purchase or license specific images. What types of prints do you offer? I offer a variety of prints, including fine art prints, canvas prints, and standard photo prints in various sizes. How are the prints produced? All prints are locally produced, using high-quality materials and professional-grade printers to ensure vibrant colors and sharp details. Can I choose custom sizes for my prints? Yes! Custom sizes are available upon request; however, the maximum print size depends on the image quality. For example, a 35mm analog image won't have the same maximum print size as a digital 40MP image. Please reach out for guidance on the best size for each image. How do I place an order for prints? You can place your order by contacting me directly for specific requests until the webshop is online. Do you offer framing services? I do not offer framing myself; however, if you’re nearby, I can help connect you with local artisans to get your project framed. Portrait Photography # What are TFP shoots? And do you offer TFP sessions? Yes, I offer TFP, which stands for - Time for Print - where, both the photographer and the model agree to work together without payment. They are not working for nothing, instead they collaborate on a project to exchange services for edited images, benefiting both parties' portfolios. What types of portrait sessions do you offer? I offer a range of portrait sessions, including individual portraits, family portraits, and professional headshots. How long does a typical portrait session last? Most portrait sessions last between 1 to 2 hours, allowing enough time to capture a variety of poses and setups. Can I choose the location for my portrait session? Absolutely! You can choose a location that is meaningful to you, whether it’s outdoors, in an urban setting, or in a studio environment. How many images can I expect per shoot? Depending on the session's length and support used, you can typically expect around 5 to 20 final edited images from each shoot. Keep in mind that for 35mm film, I'll have 36 exposures per roll, while large format photography captures only one image per sheet. The type of support used will ultimately impact both the cost of the session and the number of images delivered. How will I receive my portraits? Once your portraits are ready, you'll receive them via a secure online gallery, where you can download high-resolution files. Do you offer retouching services for the portraits? Yes, all portraits include a basic level of retouching to enhance the final images while maintaining a natural look. Do you provide RAW files? I never provide RAW files. Events Photography # What types of events do you cover? I cover a variety of events but mostly indoor or outdoor sporting events and live music. Do you cover weddings? I do not cover weddings, as there are already many talented wedding photographers out there who specialize in capturing those special moments. I focus on other types of events to provide the best experience for my clients. How long do you stay at an event? I typically offer packages that range from a few hours to full-day coverage, depending on your needs. Can I request specific shots or moments to be captured? Absolutely! Sharing your desired shots or moments in advance helps me ensure I capture everything that’s important to you.

I’ve since collected a variety of old cameras, ranging from 35mm to 120mm and large format. I find the film process to be refreshingly different and truly enjoy the slower pace it demands—from taking the shot to developing and scanning the film. In a world where everything seems to happen immediately, this alternative approach allows me to step down for a moment and appreciate the true magic of photography.\nIMAGE\nEvents # My photography journey has been deeply influenced by my passion for outdoor sports, shaping my work in event photography. This passion drives me to capture the dynamic energy of various activities, like mountain biking, skiing and mountaineering. I also enjoy capturing indoor sporting events and live music for the energy and emotions these events provide.\nIMAGE\n** CONTACT FORM**\n","date":"8 March 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/work/","section":"Welcome to my photography website!","summary":"Learn more about me and my work.","title":"My Work","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
