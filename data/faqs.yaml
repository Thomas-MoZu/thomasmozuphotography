      answer: Yes, I offer TFP, which stands for - Time for Print - where, both the photographer and the model agree to work together without payment. They are not working for nothing, instead they collaborate on a project to exchange services for edited images, benefiting both parties' portfolios.

    - question: How many images can I expect per shoot?
      answer: Depending on the session's length and support used, you can typically expect around 5 to 20 final edited images from each shoot.
